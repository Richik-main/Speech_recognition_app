Speech Transcription, Sentiment Analysis, and Multilingual Translation in Flask: An Integrated Application
Abstract
In this paper, we present a Flask-based web application that integrates various Natural Language Processing (NLP) functionalities, including speech transcription, sentiment analysis, and multilingual translation. The application allows users to upload audio files in WAV format, transcribe the speech into text using Google's Speech Recognition API, and perform sentiment analysis using pre-trained models from Hugging Face's Transformers library. Furthermore, the system provides multilingual translation capabilities, supporting translations into Hindi, Spanish, and French. The modular design of the system enables scalability for integrating additional NLP functionalities.

1. Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become an essential tool in many applications, ranging from virtual assistants to automated translation. Integrating various NLP functionalities into a cohesive application can significantly enhance user experience and productivity. This paper presents an implementation that combines speech transcription, sentiment analysis, and multilingual translation functionalities into a single Flask-based web application.

The application is designed to accept audio files, convert them into text, analyze the sentiment of the transcribed text, and translate it into multiple languages. By utilizing pre-trained models from Hugging Face’s Transformers library, the system delivers state-of-the-art performance without requiring extensive computational resources.

2. System Architecture
The core architecture of the system consists of the following components:

Flask Web Application: Flask serves as the web framework that routes user requests and responses, providing a lightweight, scalable architecture suitable for integrating the various NLP services.

Speech Transcription Module: This module uses Google’s Speech Recognition API to transcribe audio files. The transcription process converts spoken language into written text, enabling further analysis and translation.

Sentiment Analysis Module: This module employs pre-trained sentiment analysis models from Hugging Face’s cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment and bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion to classify the sentiment and emotion in the transcribed text.

Multilingual Translation Module: For translation, we leverage Hugging Face’s Transformer models for English-to-Hindi, English-to-Spanish, and English-to-French translation, using models from Helsinki-NLP.

Each of these components operates independently but is seamlessly integrated into the application workflow.

3. Modules and Functionality
3.1 Speech Transcription
The transcription module uses Python’s speech_recognition library to process audio files in WAV format. The function transcribe_audio() listens to the audio file and uses Google's Speech API to transcribe it. The transcription is saved into a text file for further use. Error handling mechanisms ensure proper user feedback in case of unrecognized speech or network errors.

Example:
python
Copy code
# Transcribing audio to text
with sr.AudioFile(audio_path) as source:
    audio_data = recognizer.record(source)
    text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
3.2 Sentiment Analysis
Once the transcription is complete, the sentiment analysis module can be invoked. Two models are used for sentiment and emotion detection. The first model maps the text to labels such as "Positive", "Neutral", or "Negative", while the second model identifies emotions like joy, sadness, or anger.

Example:
python
Copy code
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment")
sentiment_result = classifier(sentence)
3.3 Multilingual Translation
The multilingual translation module translates the transcribed text into three target languages: Hindi, Spanish, and French. The system uses Helsinki-NLP’s translation models, which are fine-tuned for high accuracy on specific language pairs.

Example for Hindi Translation:
python
Copy code
translator = pipeline("translation_en_to_hi", model="Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-hi")
translated_text = translator(sentence)[0]['translation_text']
4. Error Handling and File Validation
The application performs file validation to ensure that the uploaded file is in the proper WAV format. Using Python’s wave library, the system validates the file structure before proceeding with transcription. If the file is invalid, an appropriate error message is returned to the user.

Example:
python
Copy code
def is_valid_wav(file_path):
    try:
        with wave.open(file_path, 'rb') as wav_file:
            wav_file.getparams()
        return True
    except wave.Error as e:
        return False
5. Results and Discussion
5.1 Transcription Accuracy
The system effectively converts clear audio into text using Google’s Speech Recognition API. Accuracy can vary depending on the clarity of speech, background noise, and file quality. WAV files are preferred because of their lossless nature, ensuring minimal degradation in transcription quality.

5.2 Sentiment Analysis Performance
Using pre-trained models for sentiment analysis offers high accuracy for common language constructs. The RoBERTa-based model and emotion classification model correctly identify emotions in standard text but may struggle with sarcasm, idiomatic expressions, or ambiguous phrases.

5.3 Translation Quality
The Helsinki-NLP models used for translation are fine-tuned for specific language pairs, resulting in high-quality translations. However, challenges arise when translating domain-specific terminology or idiomatic phrases. The system is designed for general-purpose text and may require domain-specific training for specialized applications.

6. Conclusion
This paper presents a comprehensive application that integrates speech transcription, sentiment analysis, and multilingual translation into a single, easy-to-use interface. The system leverages Flask for web interactions, Hugging Face models for sentiment analysis and translation, and Google’s Speech API for transcription. The modular nature of the application allows for future expansion, such as adding support for more languages or integrating additional NLP tasks like summarization.

This system demonstrates the potential of integrating multiple NLP tasks into a unified application, enabling seamless text processing from audio input to language output.

7. Future Work
In future versions, we aim to:

Integrate support for additional languages and NLP tasks, such as text summarization or question answering.
Improve sentiment analysis by fine-tuning models with domain-specific datasets.
Enhance transcription accuracy for noisy environments by incorporating advanced speech enhancement techniques.
